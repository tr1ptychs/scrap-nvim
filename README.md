# scrap.nvim

### What it do
Creates a command `:ScrapToggle` that opens and closes a piece of "scrap paper" for ideas, notes, your grocery list, etc.

You can also use Esc in normal mode to close the window when it's open.

Closing the floating window saves it automatically, and will persist across sessions.

### Setup
Use the package manager of your choice. Just set a keymap for toggling the window using the command `:ScrapToggle`

### FYI
- This was created in an afternoon by a noob. 
- This is my first nvim plugin.
- This is currently in an 'unfinished' state.
- Do with this information what you will, use at your own risk.

### Todo:
- Make the window prettier
